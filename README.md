If you use microshaft windblows or an itoddler device, please use my finished autoexec project over at:
https://github.com/MooZonkey/autoexec

This project is designed for maximum compatibility with Team Fortress 2 running the native linux client.
For some strange reason, my main config crashes TF2's linux client. 
Tested working 2024JUL25.
