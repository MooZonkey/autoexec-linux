If you use microshaft windblows or an itoddler device, please use my finished autoexec project over at:
https://github.com/MooZonkey/autoexec


For some strange reason, my main config crashes TF2's linux client.
This project is designed for maximum compatibility with Team Fortress 2 running the native linux client. This project will run fine on different clients, but it's far more stripped down than my main project. 
autoexec-linux is minimal, the meat and potatoes of the most necessary commands for FPS and QoL fixes.
